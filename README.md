# Discontinued
I am sorry, but it is difficult to continue maintaining the open source project of Eco Computer Core. To put it simply, a large-scale project like this for one person to handle, and just another modeler, while there is little traffic on the GitHub page for ECC made it unreasonable to continue updating this page. I hope you understand my decision. Thanks.
