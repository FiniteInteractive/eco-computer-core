# Discontinued
I am sorry, but it is difficult to continue maintaining the open source project of Eco Computer Core. To put it simply, a large-scale project like this for one person to handle, and just another modeler, while there is little traffic on the GitHub page made it unreasonable to continue updating this page. I hope you understand my decision. Thanks.

## Contribution
You can continue to make contributions, but there is a slim chance that your contributions may make it onto my game.
